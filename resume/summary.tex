Currently I am a Master student in Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), and my expected graduation time is September 2020. My major research interest is in computer vision (specifically, multi-object tracking) and ubiquitous computing in smart cities. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in software engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University in China before proceeding with my education in Japan. I have great interest in deep learning and artificial intelligence and have some experience in software designing and development. My dream is to develop intelligence-powered software products that improve the quality of people's daily life and push forward the progress of computer technology.
